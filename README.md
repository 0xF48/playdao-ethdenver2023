### PLAYDAO.ai
Inefficient education, bureaucracy, corruption, zero-sum markets, hyper-fi, environmental destruction, and homelessness — these are all challenges we believe modern blockchain primitives can solve.

We’re working to fix these problems with our interoperable, no-code protocol dapp. PLAYDAO facilitates positive community impact through gamified, merit-based reward structures in the form of chained quests and badges. 

There’s so much imperative work that’s not getting done because existing tools for hiring are too cumbersome. People have qualifications with too few ways to actually prove them. Work doesn’t get done because that work is boring and tedious. PLAYDAO adds more play into work. 

It lowers barriers to entry, which opens opportunities for those more disadvantaged, and increases the amount of work accomplished. This is crucial since most agencies have rising costs from deferred maintenance and are underfunded, leading to unmet needs.

We’ve created simple primitives applying Ethereum attestations and sybil-resistant trust networks. As you complete quests, become more educated and earn trust, you unlock higher permissions, exclusive events, games, and prizes. Sponsors provide monetary awards. AI analyzes profiles to match the most suitable quests with actors, based on their skills and interests. It also matches people with similar profiles so they can work together. 

PLAYDAO is privacy native — we’re exploring zero-knowledge proofs so members have the freedom to reveal their contributions if they choose to. 

PLAYDAO strengthens organizations and communities by enabling increasingly efficient and effective structures, to create a more healthy and fair world.
